# InstrumentHome

A Basic Home app with just enough functionality to make a phone a dedicated Vario/GPS instrument using app such as XCTrack, AVario etc.

*NOTE:* the power-off on-screen button requires **root** access on a android device which on Android 4.3 onwards means you need to use TWRP for recovery and install SuperSU-1.43 or later or other variant that knows how to cope with the LinuxSE restrictions.

# Usage

If you make this your default home app, you can only change that (without adb access) by going into Settings->Apps->InstrumentHome and in there removing its home default.


## TODO

* Allow selecting vario app to be started via "main button"
* Add setting to auto-start on-boot selected app
